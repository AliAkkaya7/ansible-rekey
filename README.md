# Ansible Rekey Encrypted Variables

There are options that you can encrypt the file or variables itself in Ansible vault. When the file is encrypted all variables will be part of it. Encryption variables allow you to have this encryption for each variable that has sensitive content. It is not easy to rekey all encryption variables while encrypt_string does not have this option. This collection will help you during the rotation of the vault password and re-encrypt the variables.

## Use case of ansible_rekey_variables

It is a collection for managing vaulted Ansible inventories. It helps to rekey all encrypted variables in the inventory repository. Can also be used to encrypt variables from clear text. Thus, without having to encrypt each variable separately, it does this for you in the file where the variable is located.

We demonstrate in this document how to run this collection locally. Don't forget, this role also can be part of a pipeline or run from Ansible Automation Platform. This pipeline / AAP template also can create the Pull Request that includes all the changes.

### Information for Encrypted Variables

While `ansible-vault` has a rekey option to change the vault password, `ansible-vault encrypt_string` doesn't have an option. The goal of this collection is to automate changing vault passwords for all encrypted variables under the inventory group_vars and host_vars.

More details can be found in this [link](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html#creating-encrypted-variables) on encrypted variables.

### Example for encrypted variable

----
Simply run the command below for the variable you want to encrypt, then enter the new vault password. You can use this output in your inventory to store variables as encrypted.

````bash
----
#$ ansible-vault encrypt_string '<Put the Password here>' --name 'aap_admin_password'
New Vault password:
Confirm New Vault password:
aap_admin_password: !vault |

## Prerequisites

* Ansible version 2.9+ should be available locally. Ansible-core package installation is enough.
* Inventory repositories that hold the encrypted variables should be cloned to the local directory before performing the vault password change.
* Git also should be available on your local command line.


## Requirements

The following package is required to use this collection.

| Name             | Minimum Version |
|------------------|:---------------:|
| ansible-core     | 2.9+            |


## Installation

You should install this collection on your local environment.

````bash

ansible-galaxy collection install vaulted_inventory-vaulted_variable-1.0.0.tar.gz

````

### Role Variables

Role variables are defined in [defaults/main.yml](defaults/main.yml).

  * `rekey_variable_rekey_variable_vault_file_patterns`: It will search in the inventory file for this regex. You can change it if you have different file naming convention.

Basically, ``new_vault_password`` and ``inventory_repo_name`` should be defined to be able to change the vault password.

### Role Tags

This role accepts the following tags to customize which part of the deployment is executed.

* aap_vault_change
* aap_post_tasks

## Inventory Repository

Clone the inventory repository to your local directory.

````bash
git clone <inventory_repository>
````

### Example for Encrypted Variables in inventory repository

These variables are stored in vault_ prefix named files.

## How to run the playbook

This test.yml can be tested in the tests directory.

### Example Playbook

```yaml
---
- name: Change vault password for all encrypted variables in Roles
  hosts: localhost
  gather_facts: false
  roles:
    - role: ../../rekey_variable
      when:
        - vault_change is defined
        - vault_change | bool
      tags: aap_vault_change
```

### Run the playbook locally

An option such as ``--vault-id new_vault_password@prompt`` can be passed while running the playbook. It will prompt for a new vault password, and a new password can be entered. This prevents variables from being decrypted during the rerun if the playbook was interrupted during the previous run. If it is interrupted, some variables may be rekeyed with the new variables and some may remain with the old encryption key.

````bash
ansible-playbook -i <inventory_repo_path>  test.yml \
--tags "aap_vault_change" --ask-vault-pass \
    --vault-id new_vault_password@prompt
````

### How to check the variables with new key

These variables are stored in vault_ prefix named files.After the rekey variables are completed you can test to view the encrypted variables with the new vault password. You just need to point the file and encrypted variable as shown in the below command.

DESCRIPTION
````bash
ansible localhost -m ansible.builtin.debug -a var="encrypted_var1" -e "@<inventory_repo_path>/vault_test_data.yml" --ask-vault-pass
Vault password:
localhost | SUCCESS =>
    "encrypted_var1": "test1"
````


It can be tested with the debug module as described in this [example](https://docs.ansible.com/ansible/latest/user_guide/vault.html#viewing-encrypted-variables).
